 Analysis of an informal poll I took. In progress.

The original survey text: 

1. Do you, even jokingly/informally, talk about computers or software as if they are capable of acting independently or are social entities? (E.g. "oh, the computer said no" or "[this software] is really trying to mess with me today".)
2. Do you believe that large language models (like BERT or GPT-3) are capable of understanding language in some meaningful way? 
3. Do you believe that spell checkers are, in some meaningful way, capturing what you meant to say?
4. Do you work in technology as a field? (Broadly defined)
5. Do you have training (broadly defined) in human cognition, neuroscience or a social science (e.g. sociology, linguistics, anthropology, etc.)?
